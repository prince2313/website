          <h3>Synopsis</h3>
          <p>In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing
            game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the aid of "NerveGear" technology, players can control
            their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.

            Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed "Kirito," is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first
            shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate
            world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of
            events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world
            until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.

            In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are
            allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from
            the ruthless game. To make matters worse, SAO is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in
            real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his
            virtual hell.</p>

            <p>In the year 2022, Kirito (the main protagonist), a solo player who had the luck-of-the-draw to play the
              beta version, and the many other players of Sword Art Online (SAO) are trapped inside of a game, unable to
              logout; the only way to live is to win. Death in-game means death in the real world; tampering with or
              prolonged power outages to the NerveGear, the gear that simulates in-game character control by redirecting
              brain signals, also means death. To win means to defeat the final boss on the top floor; out of the
              original 10,000 players at the start, two years later, over 6,000 remain with 26 floors left to clear.</p>

              NerveGear and have failed to awaken. Kazuto finds a picture of what looks like Asuna in one of the other
              VRMMO games known as ALfheim Online (ALO). And so he must now embark on another quest for the sake of his
              love, who is held captive in ALfheim Online.</p>

          <h3>Synopsis</h3>
          <p>A year after escaping Sword Art Online, Kazuto Kirigaya has been settling back into the real world.
            However, his peace is short-lived as a new incident occurs in a game called Gun Gale Online, where a player
            by the name of Death Gun appears to be killing people in the real world by shooting them in-game. Approached
            by officials to assist in investigating the murders, Kazuto assumes his persona of Kirito once again and
            logs into Gun Gale Online, intent on stopping the killer.

            Once inside, Kirito meets Sinon, a highly skilled sniper afflicted by a traumatic past. She is soon dragged
            in his chase after Death Gun, and together they enter the Bullet of Bullets, a tournament where their target
            is sure to appear. Uncertain of Death Gun's real powers, Kirito and Sinon race to stop him before he has the
            chance to claim another life. Not everything goes smoothly, however, as scars from the past impede their
            progress. In a high-stakes game where the next victim could easily be one of them, Kirito puts his life on
            the line in the virtual world once more.</p>

              VRMMOs has progressed extensively. However, Gun Gale Online, a VRMMO game that focuses on guns and
              shooting rather than sword and sorcery, has had some of their players killed by a certain individual while
              in the game world, but the mystery is that they also died at the same time in the real world. Kirito must
              once again embark for a new world in search of the man supposedly behind the deaths, "Death Gun".</p>

        <p>In the year 2026, a highly-advanced augmented reality console known as the Augma entered the market as an
          alternative to the most widely used virtual reality console, the AmuSphere. With the introduction of Ordinal
          Scale (OS), the first Augmented Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (ARMMORPG) for the
          Augma, the new console quickly became popular.

          On April 24, 2026, having learnt about rumors of Sword Art Online (SAO) monsters appearing in OS from his
          friends, Kirigaya Kazuto (Kirito) decides to participate in a boss fight alongside Yuuki Asuna and Tsuboi
          Ryoutarou (Klein). As the players participating in the battle struggled with the boss, the second-ranked
          player in the game, Eiji, suddenly joined the fight, helping change the tide of battle.

          Meanwhile, as Asuna becomes more and more interested in playing the game, SAO Survivors find themselves losing
          their memories from their Sword Art Online days after encountering Eiji.</p>

      <p>The Soul Translator is a state-of-the-art full-dive interface which interacts with the user's Fluctlight—the
        technological equivalent of a human soul—and fundamentally differs from the orthodox method of sending signals
        to the brain. The private institute Rath aims to perfect their creation by enlisting the aid of Sword Art Online
        survivor Kazuto Kirigaya. He works there as a part-time employee to test the system's capabilities in the
        Underworld: the fantastical realm generated by the Soul Translator. As per the confidentiality contract, any
        memories created by the machine in the virtual world are wiped upon returning to the real world. Kazuto can only
        vaguely recall a single name, Alice, which provokes a sense of unease when mentioned in reality.

        When Kazuto escorts Asuna Yuuki home one evening, they chance upon a familiar foe. Kazuto is mortally wounded in
        the ensuing fight and loses consciousness. When he comes to, he discovers that he has made a full-dive into the
        Underworld with seemingly no way to escape. He sets off on a quest, seeking a way back to the physical world
        once again.</p>

      contacting the real world, Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya finds out that the Ocean Turtle—a mega-float controlled by
      Rath—was raided. Due to a sudden short-circuit caused by the raiders, Kirito's fluctlight is damaged, leaving him
      comatose. Feeling insecure about the people at the Axiom Church, Alice brings the unconscious Kirito back to their
      hometown—Rulid Village, disregarding her banishment due to an unabsolved crime. Now, Alice is living an ordinary
      and peaceful life close by the village, wishing for Kirito to wake up.

      However, tragedy strikes when Alice notices that the Dark Territory has already started to invade the Human
      Empire. Reassuming her previous alias, Alice Synthesis Thirty, she promises to defeat the Dark Territory in order

    One month has passed since Akihiko Kayaba's deadly game began, and the body count continues to rise. Two thousand
    players are already dead.

    Kirito and Asuna are two very different people, but they both desire to fight alone. Nonetheless, they find
    themselves drawn together to face challenges from both within and without. Given that the entire virtual world they
    now live in has been created as a deathtrap, the surviving players of Sword Art Online are starting to get
    desperate, and desperation makes them dangerous to loners like Kirito and Asuna. As it becomes clear that solitude

    and in so doing survive?

    Sword Art Online: Progressive is a new version of the Sword Art Online tale that starts at the beginning of Kirito

    in the firearm-centered world of the virtual reality game Gun Gale Online. But in real life, this feared player
    killer is not quite who anyone would expect.

    A shy university student in Tokyo, Karen Kohiruimaki stands in stark contrast to her in-game avatar—in fact, she
    happens to stand above everyone else too, much to her dismay. Towering above all the people around her, Karen's
    insecurities over her height reach the point where she turns to the virtual world for an escape. Starting game after
    game in hopes of manifesting as a cute, short character, she finally obtains her ideal self in the world of Gun Gale
    Online. Overjoyed by her new persona, she pours her time into the game as LLENN, garnering her reputation as the
    legendary player killer.

    However, when one of LLENN's targets gets the best of her, she ends up meeting Pitohui, a skilled yet eccentric
    woman. Quickly becoming friends with Karen, Pitohui insists that LLENN participates in Squad Jam, a battle royale
    that pits teams against one another, fighting until only one remains. Thrust into the heated competition, LLENN must
    fight with all her wit and will if she hopes to shoot her way to the top.
